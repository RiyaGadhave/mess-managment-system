# mess-managment-system


A comprehensive mess management solution built in C programming language for canteens, hostels, colleges, and offices. This system provides an efficient way to manage meal services, track customer visits, and collect valuable feedback.

## 🍽️ Overview

The Mess Management System is designed to streamline food service operations by providing user authentication, weekly menu display, time tracking, and feedback collection. The system ensures secure access through a login mechanism and offers detailed meal information including pricing for different meal plans.
